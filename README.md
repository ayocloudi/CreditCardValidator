# CreditCardValidator
This program validates credit card numbers using Luhn's Algorithm. Users input a card number, which is then checked for its legitimacy. The process involves reversing the card digits, doubling every second digit, adjusting digits over nine, summing all digits, and confirming the sum is divisible by 10.
